We developed the system using Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval, which allows us to efficiently manage video embeddings for various data types, including captions, transcripts, and objects. The embeddings were generated using models from Together AI. The RAG mechanism forms the system's backbone, retrieving the relevant embeddings based on the user’s query and synthesizing a response. We deployed the system using Vessl AI, providing an efficient model training and deployment platform. The entire workflow is orchestrated via multi-agent tools that handle specific tasks related to video data—such as captioning, object detection, and transcript analysis—seamlessly. We have monitored and debugged the entire architecture using Arize which is super easy to start with. <br />
